# 🎲 Dice Roller app

A set of dices that roll on touch and show the sum of the values

## 🚩 Getting Started

This project is an initial practise for a Flutter application. Here it is applied the BLoC pattern (Bussiness Logic Components) to separate the logic of the application from the way it is shown on screen.

This work started from the template of a simple counter app (initial commit)

## 🎯 Objectives
- Get in touch with main widgets and layout
- Understand BLoC logic and advantages
- Learn how user inputs (events) are managed 

## ⏯️ Demo
